# How to research?
find a topic
what are ur questions and curiousity exactly about?
divide primary and secondary ressearch points
those which are obvious and think already info is out there, then just do secondary research, papers, videos, etc media.
those not obvious, ask chatgpt to research but u need to have a perspective for that so that you can zoom in and zoom out while researching on granualr aspects

what looks digitially?
what happens analog wise?
how do they communicate? frequency? how are those tapped into?


info is everywhere
both analog and digital carries information or former is converted to digital
then know about analog systems
then about digital systems
diff between analog logic and digital logic
and how it works
this bridges the gap betwenn both worlds
think both worlds as 2 huge systems
think in systems
what are systems from natural eco system to digital ecosystem
how communication of info takes place across all in between or something above
how real time is it?
why analog systems are still needed
learn identifying info, storing information, accessing, process manually
organize in mini stacks and be familiar with analog nature of info
how to structure a pile of unorganized desk filled with information like murder mystery clues
    - will come later on what are clues to information?
and in what ways we can organize a messy desk how many possibilities?
where to store the things on the desk? drawers, bean bag, on other chair, bed, designated piece on floor temporarily
we need temp and persist storage
    - bills on the desk will go to trash after a while
    - pen in the drawer or pen stand
Learn about Storage history
Learn about Information processing, glyphs, cave paintings, and other history
Noise to No Noise
    unstructured data - noise
    structured data - little no noise
    how to structure data and its importance in desired information
    what is a structure at its core???
What does structure do in the system?
structure and system what is the relation?
what does a system do - traffic systems, eco ssytem, hunting, hospitals, communities?

systems can be divided into sub systems
each sub system can perform a set of tasks and serving some information to the person using the system
every sub-system has its sub systems down to minute level like a spiral not a circle

who uses a system - we call them users of the system
relationship between system and user
communication between system and user
levels of communication
- based on the use case, requirements, info needs, etc, user interacts with sys
- interactions are ways user uses to instruct the system
    - abstract interactions like using OS GUI
    - non abstract interactions like using terminal commands, using scripts, prog langs
What are OS?
operating system
what is operating in sys?
"The Essence of Operating: Universal Principles Across Systems"

how technical systems are no different that natural systems
how we integrated natural system behaviours into techology

what is that common pattern??

things in a sys interacts in a living working sys
if not interacting then not a living sys or sys at halt or breakdown
there are ways the info sharing and interactions happening
Why interaction is needed? to sustain?? is sustaining the purpose of every system or most systems?
what is purpose in any system naturally and tech wise?
everything has purpose and nothing has purpose

controlled vs uncontrolled systems; former has purpose, later none
the forest system is not in our contro;, the traffic system is in police control.
similarly what things are in our control and what things are not?
why not interact with uncontrolled sys? - if something is working dont fix it! Nature follows that.
how do we use, organize info, use info and perform operations in a controlled sys?
information divided into pieces is data and data accumulated with meaning and message is information to process
we need to interact with the sys realtimely
imagine non predictable days ahead or unpredictable outcomes. we need predicatble and repeated process to perform certain operations.

what are thsoe processes like?
in a forest what all processes happen? how each processes are independent, co dependent, and interdependent?
how is the process of a tiger in a forest is diff from that of a plant or tree? 
what is the role of something process?
processes repeatable and cyclical in nature are algorithms, simple steps leading to cmplex things.
what is a process in natural terms? in the simplest word possible?
how can we witness a process? of cooking for example. - cooking is a process done daily but cyclical. every day repeats 3 times. anything that happens in loop is a process.
manual vs automatic processing
what do we process exactly? cook, burn, consume?
on what do we process?
what do we get from process?
an outcome and we want that outcome everyday
to process something we need:
input (ingredients)
processing of data (the ingredients)
output (food or any end result, information in desired format or place, where would u like ur food?)

that processing is what most systems do - from OS to a simple messaging app and everything in between

# that processing in systems is called Algorithms
there are many happening at once or concurrently or parallely

creating order in sys

so all these: order, process, loop, outcome all converge into big processes. The how ??
Like cooking process is algorithm to beat hunger and sustain
water cycle is for rain
so we have many algorithms...
what are algos? - nature, history,
demystifiying algos
how data, info, algos - cyclical nature

so what is information, again?
anything that can be understood, acted upon, relied upon, investigate upon, dissect onto understand, think, convey, action taken
movement of information, method, how to? algos is not the end.
in many subsystems, information gets in and all out all the time.
we need to do things with these information - read, identify, analyse, store, and build a structure around it.
for that we have temp containers, dust bins, drawers and cupboards, racks or temp bowls in real life.

## movement of information, method, how to? algos is not the end.
when info is moving, it needs place to rest or store values to keep organized.

you see, all these infos are moving from one place to another and in cycles, thanks to feedback loop - by why is feedback loop required and why did it emerge?

we need to do things with these information - read, identify, analyse, track, store, and build a structure around it.
for that we have temp containers, dust bins, drawers and cupboards, racks or temp bowls in real life.
all these have information processed or waiting to be processed.

but why do we need to structure it?? because entropy?? like what is a structure generally??
data > information > algos > structure

structure??
structure are patterns both are linked So yes, structure and patterns are intrinsically linked—they're two sides of the same coin in creating order and meaning in both natural and technical systems.

building is a structure , or a system?
structure and system - what are those?

static and dynamic
how it looks or should look vs how it operates, functions
structure is the form, the shape, the geometry and system is animating those forms and shapes
structure is the plot and system is the entire movie

We can say:

Static (Structure): How it looks or is arranged—the form, shape, or plot.
Dynamic (System): How it operates, functions, or interacts—the entire movie.

This distinction helps clarify that while structure provides the framework or blueprint, the system brings it to life through interactions and processes.

so that structure will help us and system identify information in a desired way

its like visual way of learjing and textual way of learning, some are good with visually structured content and some are textual way of learning.


we need recgonizability, ability to know andidentify so there are some patterns that give rise to a structure. it can be natural or man made.

to itneract with the sys, you need to be awaer of the structure. Its like, to use a hotel building facilities, u need to know where the lifts are, where the reception is, where the restaurant or bar is? and you will be using that structure.
hence familiarity with structure is needed for smooth fucntioning.

its like structure can vary in its form and size and shape but the system, the functions will remain laregely similar

every species eat or consume food in some form. the structure of lives are diff but the inherent process of eating, reproducing, etc are the same. give me more things to connect to at this point now. not just eating and reproducing but more.

now how do we structure what?

identify what to structure?

building is a structure, but can we build it now, NO. so, lets build a wooden table
and talk abt what are the structures in a traffic system - to move out of building examples.

structure thinking vs systems thinking








# I just want to generalize each computer sci concepts and contexts both so that programming and interaction with machines and techincal systems can be increased impacting society level. especially in the age of AI. Like if not everybody can be programmer, but if they can good. If not, they should be smoothly instruct machine to take actual physical action or do desired info sharing.

we can apply this same to other fields that comp sci. which ones Idk, maybe Maths, physics, etc.
like what the heck is algorithm? why we need it?? how to convey that to a 5th grader or a non tech enthusiast.

or why desk gets disordered?
what is the natural examples where disorderness is seen when no force applied and
